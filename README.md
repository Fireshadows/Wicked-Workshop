# Wicked Workshop
First Unreal Engine project, where I practied making a FPS wave defense game and automated testings for both player movement and various main mechanics.

The wave defense game can be played in the FirstPersonExampleMap located in Content/FirstPersonBP/Maps
The automated testings are held in a separate level, FunctionTestMap, located in Content/AutomatedTest.
They can be run from session frontend window, where they are located under
Project->Functional Tests->Game/AutomatedTest/FunctionTestMap.

Running them will test the player character's ability to turn, jump, pickup collectables, run and shoot.
